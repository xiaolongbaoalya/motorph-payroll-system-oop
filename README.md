# MotorPH Payroll System – Development Branch

Welcome to the **development (`dev`) branch** of the MotorPH Payroll System.

This branch is actively used for **ongoing development**, **collaboration**, and **testing** of new features before they are finalized and merged into the `main` branch.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a working branch. Code in this branch may be incomplete or unstable.  

---

## Branch Workflow

- **`main`** – Stable, submission-ready version of the project
- **`dev`** – Main collaboration and development branch

All ongoing work, refactoring, and feature development should be done in this branch before being merged into `main`.

---

## Personal Development Folders

To support parallel development and avoid conflicts, personal development folders are used within the `dev` branch:

- `dev-mel` – Personal development folder for Mel
- `dev-aly` – Personal development folder for Aly
- `dev-fel` – Personal development folder for Felice
- `dev-shane` – Personal development folder for Shane

---

## Important Notes

- Do **not** merge directly into `main` without testing
- Code in this branch may change frequently
- Folder structure and implementation details are subject to refinement as development progresses
